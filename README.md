# BiteofEastCounty
Website for a local non-profit event.

I've done some marketing for this local event which benefits the local Food Kitchen & Pantry (Zarephath House).  Their web developer moved out of town, so it seemed like a good time to update the look.

The first version was what the client said they wanted (the Moderna theme in this repo was the demo):
http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/SandyGlantz/BiteofEastCounty/blob/master/Bite_Moderna%20copy/index.html


The second version was what they actually wanted ;-)
Currently under development as a WordPress site (so they will eventually be able to do their own maintenance):   
http://SandySandbox.com    
(will include SSL certificate when it moves from development to Live).

The current/old version is at:  
http://www.BiteofEastCounty.com
