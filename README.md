# BiteofEastCounty
Website for a local non-profit event.

I've done some marketing for this local event, which benefits the local Food Kitchen & Pantry (Zarephath House).  Their web developer moved out of town, so it seemed like a good time to update the look.

The first version was what the client said they wanted (the Moderna theme in this repo was the demo):

The second version was what they actually wanted ;-)
Currently under development as a WordPress site (so they will eventually be able to do their own maintenance):
